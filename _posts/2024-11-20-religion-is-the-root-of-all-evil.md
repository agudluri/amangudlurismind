# Religion, Nation-States, and Humanity's Struggles

Organized religion has long been a contentious topic, and for good reason. At its core, religion is meant to offer spiritual guidance and foster a sense of community. But when it morphs into an organized institution, it often becomes a tool for division, hatred, and control. This, in my opinion, makes organized religion one of the worst things to have happened to humanity.

The problems with organized religion are many. It provides a perceived sense of righteousness that anyone with a questionable moral compass can manipulate to suit their own needs. It enables hatred under the guise of morality, giving people the justification to harm others simply for being different—be it differences in skin color, language, class, or beliefs. Instead of uniting people, it creates more excuses to divide them.

But what if we look at the broader structures at play? Religion is not operating in a vacuum. Another major force perpetuating division, hatred, and control is the nation-state. The nation-state, like organized religion, is a man-made construct designed to serve power rather than people.

## The Nation-State and Its Role in Division

Take, for example, the way colonial powers arbitrarily divided Africa and the Middle East. These lines drawn on a map had nothing to do with the cultural, linguistic, or ethnic realities of the people living there. Instead, they served the expansionist goals of empires seeking land and resources. The legacy of this division is ongoing violence, conflict, and strife.

Here’s the kicker: in many cases, religion was used to justify these actions. Colonial powers didn’t just march in with armies; they carried crosses and scripture, claiming they were bringing "civilization" to the "savages." In reality, they were looting, exploiting, and destroying. Religion wasn’t just complicit; it was instrumental in these conquests.

It’s easy to see why these two systems—organized religion and the nation-state—often work hand in hand. Both thrive on the artificial imposition of identity, turning what could be fluid and shared into something rigid and exclusionary. They justify violence as necessary for the "greater good," whether that’s saving souls or protecting borders.

## Can We Separate Religion and Governance?

This brings us to a pressing question: can religion and governance be separated? On paper, the answer seems to be yes. Secular governments, such as those in France, South Korea, and Japan, show that it’s possible to create systems where religion doesn’t dictate laws or policies.

However, even in these nations, the cultural shadow of religion lingers. Religion often influences societal values and norms, seeping into areas it supposedly doesn’t control. Meanwhile, in countries like India, the divide between religion and state is blurry at best. Political parties openly exploit religious identities to gain votes, and policies are frequently influenced by religious considerations.

True secularism remains an ideal—a goal we strive for but rarely achieve.

## Why Do We Cling to These Systems?

Why do we return to systems that divide us? Perhaps it’s because they fulfill fundamental human needs. Religion offers meaning and purpose; the nation-state provides a sense of belonging. But when these systems come at the cost of harmony and shared humanity, it’s worth asking: do we really need them?

Would a world without these artificial divisions be chaotic, or would it be freer? Could humanity build systems based on unity rather than division, or are we doomed to repeat these cycles forever?

## Moving Forward: Finding Hope in Small Moments

As bleak as these reflections may seem, there are glimmers of hope. History is full of individuals and movements that have resisted these structures, striving for a world where love and unity prevail over hatred and division. From Gandhi’s fight for nonviolence to Malala’s advocacy for education, there are countless examples of people breaking free from these constructs to push humanity forward.

Sometimes, hope isn’t found in grand revolutions but in small, meaningful moments—choosing kindness over cruelty, seeking understanding instead of judgment, and appreciating the simpler joys of life. For me, animals are a perfect metaphor for this kind of purity. They live without the complex, destructive systems humans create. Even when animals fail us, it’s without malice or intent—unlike the systems we have built.

## A Vision for the Future

Imagine a world where neither religion nor the nation-state wields unchecked power over humanity. A world where identity is fluid, where borders don’t dictate who belongs and who doesn’t, and where belief systems inspire compassion rather than division.

It may seem like a pipe dream, but it starts with us. By questioning these constructs, challenging their dominance, and seeking better alternatives, we can begin to dismantle the barriers they create. The path forward won’t be easy, but it’s one worth taking.

What do you think? Can we truly separate religion and governance? Can humanity ever rise above the constructs we’ve built to divide ourselves? Let’s continue imagining, questioning, and working toward a better future.
